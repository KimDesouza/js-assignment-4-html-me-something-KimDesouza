         <p>
            Earlier this year in March, I decided to go on a trip with 
            my best friend for my birthday. One of the places I had 
            wanted to visit was Las Vegas after hearing about how fun 
            and lively a city it was. We wanted to also visited a few 
            other places while we were there so our Vegas trip ended 
            up being more of a mini road trip around Nevada, Utah and 
            Arizona. We decide to go for a week and visited the Las 
            Vegas Strip, Zion National Park and Death Valley.

               <h2>Las Vegas, NV</h2>
               <p>
                  We wanted to try everything that we could in Vegas 
                  that we couldn't experience here in the midwest. 
                  When we landed in Vegas, we had to try in & out which 
                  was the first place we went to after picking up our 
                  rental car. We then headed to our hotel, The Signature 
                  at MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip. The drive to the 
                  hotel down the strip was incredible. The whole street 
                  was lit up and we got to see so many incredible places 
                  like the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio Hotel.

                  The next day we walked down the strip to the 
                  Cosmopolitan for brunch. We then went on the Big Bus
                  tour which took us through some of the landmarks in 
                  Las Vegas. The first stop we got of at was for the High
                  Roller/LINQ Promenade where they had a version of a 
                  version of the Ferris Wheel ride and a Zipline. The 
                  High Roller is the largest observation wheel in North 
                  America whith an amazing view of the City or Las Vegas 
                  from 550 feet high.The Fly LINQ zipline is 12 stories 
                  above the LINQ promenade (a street with various 
                  different restaurants and stores) with speeds of up 
                  to 35 miles per hour.

                  After the visit to the LINQ Promenade we went to The 
                  Strat Hotel. We went up to the SkyPod which was an 
                  observation deck at the top of the hotel which also 
                  had an incredible view of the city. They also had a 
                  few rides one of which was the X-Scream. The X-Scream 
                  is a giant teeter-totter ride on the edge of the 
                  building about 866 feet high. The ride propels you 
                  headfirst, 27 feet over the edge of the tower.

                  Once we were done at The Strat, we had dinner at a Thai
                  restaurant and got to try some new dishes that were 
                  delicious. After dinner we headed back to the hotel at 
                  the end of the night. The next day we decided to go to 
                  the New York, New York Hotel to try the Big Apple
                  Roller Coaster Ride which was incredibly thrilling.

                  Later that evening we went to watch the Cirque du 
                  Soleil - Mystere show at the Treasure Island Hotel. 
                  While waiting for the show we decided to try playing 
                  at the casino and ended up winning $100. We then went 
                  in for the show which had incredible performance. I 
                  would definitely recommend going to watch at least one 
                  if possible.

               <h2>Zion National Park</h2>
               <p>
                  The next day we drove to Zion National Park where we 
                  had booked a UTV tour on the Peak-A-Boo and Breat 
                  Chamber Trail. The tour included driving the utv and 
                  hiking to some of the views. Some of the hikes were 
                  though the canyons and up to the sand dunes which 
                  were absolutley beautiful. We even got to drive the 
                  utv a few time with out tour guide which was such a 
                  unique experience very much different to driving a car 
                  and even more thrilling. Overall, it was a very fun 
                  experience that I would definitley try again however, 
                  we were both very exhausted by the end of the day and 
                  decided to return to out hotel to rest.

                  On our last day we returned to Las Vegas and decided 
                  to go to Chinatown to try a few restaurants there. We 
                  had sushi at a revolving sushi bar which was an 
                  interesting first time experience. We also picked up 
                  some treats at a bakery such as custard buns, lemon 
                  cupcakes, mango cake and bubble tea. Before heading to 
                  the airport we decided to visit the Las Vegas Sign for 
                  some picture.

                  Overall, it was a wonderful trip with various different
                  experiences. I would like to re-visit Vegas again as 
                  there are still so many things to do there that I didn't
                  get the chance to. I would definitely recommend visiting 
                  when possible because it's a very memorable place with 
                  lots of things to do.
